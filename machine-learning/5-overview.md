# Lab #5: Computer Vision at the Edge End to End

The objective of this lab is to learn how to deploy an end to end machine learning solution using real devices. Simulation elements are mostly avoided. The setup includes a computer vision model at the edge for inference with a Raspberry Pi device, creation of a new IoT Greengrass component, report of real GPS locations of the objects detected and the use of AWS Location Service to define a real geofence so that a special treatment is provided to the detection events of pedestrians in a particular road.  A USB camera attached to the Raspberry Pi is included to capture the images.
