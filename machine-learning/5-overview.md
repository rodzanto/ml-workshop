# Lab #5: Computer Vision at the Edge End to End

The objective of this lab is to learn how to deploy an end to end machine learning solution using real devices and avoiding simulations. The setup includes a computer vision model at the edge for inference with a Raspberry Pi device, the creation a new IoT Greengrass component to overcome some limitations of the public TensorFlow component, the report of real GPS locations of the objects detected and the use of AWS Location Service to define a real geofence so that a special treatment is provided to pedestrians detected in a particular road.  A USB camera attached to the Raspberry Pi is included to capture the images.
