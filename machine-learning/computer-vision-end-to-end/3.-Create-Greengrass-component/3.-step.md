# Create a new TensorFlowLiteObjectDetection component 

We need to create a new version of the TensorFlowLiteObjectDetection for our Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS Debian with a USB camera attached. 

From the console navigate to *AWS IoT-->Manage-->Greengrass devices -->Components*
Then click on "Create component" .

In the next screen we will select as Component Source **"Entire recipe as JSON"**

For the recipe, you can copy the contents of the recipe.json file available in the github folder (*https://github.com/rodzanto/ml-workshop/tree/master/machine-learning/computer-vision-end-to-end/3.-Create-Greengrass-component*). 
You may need to change the version in the recipe file to make it unique to your component creation --> "ComponentVersion": "2.1.8",

You can provide your own name for the component in the recipe file. In the recipe provided in this workshop, we are naming our new component as *aws.greengrass.TensorFlowLiteObjectDetection.mod*

The recipe file contains an object called **Artifacts**. 
You should add a "Uri" to your own S3 bucket where you have stored the compressed artifacts files (*object_detection.zip*).

In the github folder (*https://github.com/rodzanto/ml-workshop/tree/master/machine-learning/computer-vision-end-to-end/3.-Create-Greengrass-component*) of this chapter you can find the **object_detection.zip** file that you need to store in your S3 bucket. 

The zip package includes a directory named **sample_image** (where you store the image in case you don't want to use the Camera) and a set of python files. 

We have made some changes to the original **prediction_utils.py** file so that it can run the inference from the USB camera and report the GPS positions. 
Those changes are implemented in the functions **def predict_from_cam():** and **def predict(image_data):** 
In addition, a new function **def getPositionData():** has been added to capture the GPS data (the function is called from **def predict(image_data)** to add the GPS coordenates to the payload of the MQTT message)

Code is available at: **https://github.com/rodzanto/ml-workshop/blob/master/machine-learning/computer-vision-end-to-end/3.-Create-Greengrass-component/prediction_utils.py**
